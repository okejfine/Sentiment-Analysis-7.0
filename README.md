# Programming for Text Processing and Analysis 7
# Uses an untagged corpus named "AWE_untagd.zip". 
# Uses the default part-of-speech tagger in the NLTK library (see relevant chapter here (Links to an external site.)) or TreeTagger to tag the AWE corpus. 
# ID's all noun + noun sequences (e.g., cell distribution, government policy) where both nouns are common nouns (not proper nouns).
# For each of the six registers in the AWE corpus, generates a frequency list of all common noun + common noun bigrams, ordered in descending order, that is, with the most frequent bigram first... 

# With a small sample of the corpus (a file or two), check precision and recall of your program. In a .docx file, write a report in which you interpret and compare the frequency of noun + noun pairs across the six registers. Also, report the precision and recall measurements in the sample of the corpus you chose.

# Here's a list of the six registers: ['JA_BI', 'JA_HI', 'PS_BI', 'PS_HI', 'TB_BI', 'TB_HI']
